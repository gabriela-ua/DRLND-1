### Goal of the Project

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible. The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1. 

Note: This project provides two different versions, one agent or 20 agents.I decided to used the second version that contains 20 identical agents with their own copy environment.

## Project requirements: See 'requirements.txt'

## Environment Details

- Set-up: Double-jointed arm which can move to target locations.
- Goal: Each agent must move its hand to the goal location, and keep it there.
- Agents: The environment contains 20 agents linked to a single Brain.
- Agent Reward Function (independent): +0.1 for each timestep agent's hand is in goal location.
- Brains: One Brain with the following observation/action space.
- Vector Observation space: 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the two arm Rigidbodies.
- Vector Action space: (Continuous) Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.
- Visual Observations: None.
- Reset Parameters: Two, corresponding to goal size, and goal movement speed.
- Benchmark Mean Reward: 30

##Approach

The high-level steps taken in building an agent that solves this environment.

1. Start the Environment
1. Evaluate the state and action space.
1. Implement the learning algorithm.
1. Results

### 1.Start the Environment
Import the required libraries and create the UnityEnvironment for this project using 20 agents.

### 2. Evaluate State & Action Space
The state space space has 33 dimensions corresponding to the position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the robotic arm. There are two sections of the arm â€” analogous to those connecting the shoulder and elbow (i.e., the humerus), and the elbow to the wrist (i.e., the forearm) on a human body.Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to the torque applied to the two joints (shoulder and elbow). Every element in the action vector must be a number between -1 and 1, making the action space continuous.

### 3.Implement the learning algorithm.

The algorithm used is Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG).

     - n_episodes (int)      : maximum number of training episodes
     - max_t (int)           : maximum number of timesteps per episode   
     - train_mode (bool)     : if 'True' set environment to training mode
     - solved_score (float)  : min avg score over consecutive episodes
     - consec_episodes (int) : number of consecutive episodes used to calculate score
     - print_every (int)     : interval to display results
     - actor_path (str)      : directory to store actor network weights
     - critic_path (str)     : directory to store critic network weights


The final hyper-parameters used were as follows: (n_episodes=500, max_t=1000, solved_score=30.0, consec_episodes=100, print_every=1, train_mode=True,actor_path='actor_ckpt.pth', critic_path='critic_ckpt.pth').

### 4.Results
Plots and Results are shown in the Jupyter notebook (Continuos_Control_20Agents_P2_AP.ipynb) and Report.

### Project Starter Code

The original Udacity repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/silviomori/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning-p2-continuous-control/archive/master.zip) 


### Distributed Training

For this project, we will provide you with two separate versions of the Unity environment:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

The second version is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  

### Solving the Environment

Note that your project submission need only solve one of the two versions of the environment. 

#### Option 1: Solve the First Version

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment,  your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

#### Option 2: Solve the Second Version

The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents.  In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,
- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30.

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.
